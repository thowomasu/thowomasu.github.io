        <h4>How do I use my free subdomain?</h4>
        <p>During checkout, you will have the option to select your desired subdomain. If nothing is provided then a default subdomain will be generated for your server using the format <em>username.server_id.frogmc.co</em>. You can find your active subdomain in your Multicraft panel at <em>panel.frogminecrafthosting.com</em> on your server management page. Simply change the text, save the page, and your subdomain will be updated. Note: if a subdomain is rejected it is likely because it already exists in our system. Please contact support if you think this is in error.</p>

        <h4>Do I get a MySQL database?</h4>
        <p>Yes, SQL databases are included with all of our packages. Your Multicraft control panel will have the information required for you to create and manage your databases.</p>

        <h4>Do I get a control panel with my server?</h4>
        <p>Yes, our custom version of the Multicraft control panel is included with all game server hosting packages. This web based panel gives you complete control over your entire server with an easy to use interface. You can access the console, servers files, databases, chat and more right from here. Please contact us if you would like to try a demo of the panel before making a purchase.</p>

        <h4>What uptime do you provide?</h4>
        <p>Our hardware has over 99.9% uptime and rarely becomes unavailable. The most common cause of a crashed Minecraft server is an issue with a plugin or mod which we can help diagnose and repair.</p>

        <h4>What is my server IP?</h4>
        <p>To find your servers IP you can log into the members area and open the control panel. On the main page for the server, you will see your IP address in the format of IP:PORT. For example: 199.192.122.144:25712. Enter this address into your game client and you will be able to connect. Please make sure you include the IP and PORT when connecting.</p>

        <h4>Do I need to use port forwarding for my server?</h4>
        <p>Not at all! We make it very easy to get started on your server with very little technical knowledge needed. We will send you the IP and Port combination that you will enter into the launcher which will work without any additional configuration.</p>

        <h4>How can I get support for my server?</h4>
        <p>Our team boasts the most comprehensive support in the Minecraft server hosting industry and we look to extend that to all games. Our support representatives have in-depth knowledge of Minecraft servers, customization and the infrastructure that we use to run them. You can reach our support team via live chat, ticket or email.</p>

        <h4>Can I change my server location?</h4>
        <p>Yes, please contact our support team <a href="#">here</a> (link to your support page) to begin the process for server migration. We will have to take your server offline temporary and the transfer time will depend on your server size. On average, a transfer between regions will be completed within a few minutes. Please note that your server IP will change so if you are using a subdomain please also request that we update this. Note: The Brazil region has an extra cost for that region and will require a paid upgrade. Please use the test location <em>br.frogmc.co</em> to gauge if it is a good fit for you.</p>

        <h4>Can I upgrade my server and add more RAM?</h4>
        <p>Yes, To upgrade your services you must log into your billing area and choose upgrade/downgrade from the left-hand menu on the service. After selecting the new package you will be able to complete the upgrade. Once payment is received your existing service will be upgraded or downgraded automatically.
